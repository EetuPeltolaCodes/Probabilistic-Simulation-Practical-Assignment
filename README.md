# Probabilistic-Simulation-Practical-Assignment
 This is the practical assignment for the Probabilistic Simulation course.

 The task of this assignment was to simulate toy production with two separate contractors with two consecutive service points. The goal was to find the best split between these two contractors and calculate the number of days it took to produce enough toys for the shop's needs with 95% confidence.
